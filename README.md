# Introduction
A compilation of python/C++ codes on different Numerical Analysis techniques.
- Numerical methods is basically a branch of mathematics in which problems are solved with the help of computer and we get solution in numerical form.
- The codes gives here solve complex mathematical problems which can not be solved easily by analytical mathematics by using simple arithmetic operations and which requires development, analysis and use of an algorithm along with some computing tools.
- These codes are used in Machine learing algorithms fgor Optimization/Encoding/Pre-processing steps.
